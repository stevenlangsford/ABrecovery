Goal is to infer x1 and x2.
True values are indicated by the green dot.
The only information available is the sum (shown as a yellow line of all consistent values), and the ordinal relation (indicated on the title)
Priors over x1 and x2 are N(0,1)
Red dots are samples taken from the model with only the calculation observation.
Blue dots are samples taken from the model with both calculation and ordinal observations.
Black lines show the limits of `equality' for the ordinal relation.
